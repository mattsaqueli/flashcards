# FlashCards!

## Context:
I completed this flashcard game as part of my first project of module two coursework for the Turing School of Software and Design Front End Web Development program, a four module, seven month focused on preparing students for a career as web developers working with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the React framework. This project was completed over the course of four days. The goal of this project was to build a fully functioning flashcard game within the terminal. 

## Installation Instructions:
1. Fork this repo.
2. Clone down the forked repo by running git clone [remote-address].
3. Move into the directory.
4. Run npm install.
5. Run node index.js, the game will begin inside your terminal!
